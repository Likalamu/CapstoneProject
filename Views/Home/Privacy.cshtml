        In general, most privacy laws require you to inform your users about the following:

        Your name (or business name), location, and contact information
        What information you’re collecting from them
        (including names, email addresses, IP addresses, and any other information)
        What methods you are using to collect their information, e.g. cookies
        The purpose for collecting this information
        How you’re keeping their information safe
        Whether or not it’s optional for them to share that information,
        how they can opt-out, and the consequences of doing so
        Any third-party services you’re using to collect, process,
        or store that information (such as an e-mail newsletter service, or advertising network)
        Following a GDPR privacy policy templates like the above can be a help on the way,
        but using a GDPR privacy policy generator (as we link to below) can be dangerous.
        You must be mindful of getting all of the relevant and required information about your website into your GDPR privacy policy.
